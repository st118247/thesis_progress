@article{O2015,
	abstract = {In this paper, a representation of the Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System â€“ based prediction model for customer churn in telecommunication industry was emulated. Exhaustive search algorithm was employed for feature selection of the most significant variables influencing churn tendency. This was with a view to identifying the key performance indicators for churn tendency. Fuzzy rules were set up to represent the antecedents with their corresponding consequents. The Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) was then trained to fine-tune the parameters. The trained FIS was then simulated, validated and verified for churn tendency prediction using MATLAB programming language tools. The proposed model will help the telecommunications industry have advanced knowledge of their customer behavior better by identifying subscribers that are likely to churn at some later date in advance. This will help keep the bottom line of Telecommunications Company in a competitive environment.},

@article{Wei2002,
	abstract = {As deregulation, new technologies, and new competitors open up the mobile telecommunications industry, churn prediction and management has become of great concern to mobile service providers. A mobile service provider wishing to retain its subscribers needs to be able to predict which of them may be at-risk of changing services and will make those subscribers the focus of customer retention efforts. In response to the limitations of existing churn-prediction systems and the unavailability of customer demographics in the mobile telecommunications provider investigated, we propose, design, and experimentally evaluate a churn-prediction technique that predicts churning from subscriber contractual information and call pattern changes extracted from call details. This proposed technique is capable of identifying potential churners at the contract level for a specific prediction time-period. In addition, the proposed technique incorporates the multi-classifier class-combiner approach to address the challenge of a highly skewed class distribution between churners and non-churners. The empirical evaluation results suggest that the proposed call-behavior-based churn-prediction technique exhibits satisfactory predictive effectiveness when more recent call details are employed for the churn prediction model construction. Furthermore, the proposed technique is able to demonstrate satisfactory or reasonable predictive power within the one-month interval between model construction and churn prediction. Using a previous demographics-based churn-prediction system as a reference, the lift factors attained by our proposed technique appear largely satisfactory.},

@article{Xie2009,
	abstract = {Churn prediction is becoming a major focus of banks in China who wish to retain customers by satisfying their needs under resource constraints. In churn prediction, an important yet challenging problem is the imbalance in the data distribution. In this paper, we propose a novel learning method, called improved balanced random forests (IBRF), and demonstrate its application to churn prediction. We investigate the effectiveness of the standard random forests approach in predicting customer churn, while also integrating sampling techniques and cost-sensitive learning into the approach to achieve a better performance than most existing algorithms. The nature of IBRF is that the best features are iteratively learned by altering the class distribution and by putting higher penalties on misclassification of the minority class. We apply the method to a real bank customer churn data set. It is found to improve prediction accuracy significantly compared with other algorithms, such as artificial neural networks, decision trees, and class-weighted core support vector machines (CWC-SVM). Moreover, IBRF also produces better prediction results than other random forests algorithms such as balanced random forests and weighted random forests.},
